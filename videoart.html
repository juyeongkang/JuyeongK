      "The Crow," is a work that feels strongly isolated. In this work, I wanted to express myself as being isolated and <br> wandering alone. When I find a crow shining in a mysterious place, I keep looking for it, but it just goes around me<br>like it's making fun of me. When I think of the word isolation, I think of loneliness and despair first I was trying to put these two feelings into my work of "Crow" as much as I could. First, to give the audience a sense of isolation, I put a combination of red and black with a dark background. Secondly, I've used black color to make myself as dark as possible and to match the overall background also, to fit the whole background. Finally, when I think of the word despair, I also think of the word hope, and to give it a feeling of hope, I put in crows that shine in an isolated area, and I look for hope, but that hope just plays around me like it's making fun of me. Ultimately, I wanted to give the audience the feeling that hope and despair are one.

    My concept of this video art is a polluted sea. In the present era where we live, environmental pollution is serious. In particular, a lot of trash is thrown into the sea. My materials were used from non-recycling waste which is common around us.
